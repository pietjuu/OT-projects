The following things are integrated in this file:

## Used devices and technologies
The lab that was created for these projects runs completely on a Raspberry Pi. The raspberry PI
has OpenPLC installed which simulates a production environment. That raspberry Pi has some LED, Servo Motor 
and push buttons connected to the GPIO ports. A more detailed setup will be described in the projects.

The lab was based on a production environment that has a PLC and an HMI. The HMI is simulated with a webserver that runs 
on the host (in this case my PC, but it could be a virtual machine or another server).  
Communication between the 2 devices is completely based on MODBUS. More information can about the MODBUS protocol 
can be found here (inser link naar wiki met modbus doc)
